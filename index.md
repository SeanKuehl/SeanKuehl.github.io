<p> Here is an example of a game I made. It's a puzzle game where you have to find bugs in code. Try it out!</p>

<!-- maybe put a header hear to mark "about me"-->
<img src="MeForWebsite.jpg" alt="Picture of me">

<p> From a young age I was hooked on video games, and it's what got me interested in programming and technology.
Now I'm pursuing a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at Conestoga College, learning a lot and doing my best.
I still find time to work on my own projects and learn new technologies to keep my mind and my skills sharp.
I'm constantly exploring and looking to create new opportunities, which is part of the reason I'm hosting my own website.
Strategy games, digital art and writing are some of my other hobbies that I explore outside of personal projects.</p>

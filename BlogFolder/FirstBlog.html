<h1> My Views On College So Far </h1>
<p> By: Sean Kuehl, March 2022 </p>
</div>



<div align = "center">
<p> I was always told that college would be "so much different" and "so much harder" compared to highschool. Now that I'm in college, I don't really think that's true.
My approach to college has been the same one I used in highschool. Get up early, get to school early and get things done before their due.
So far it's worked out pretty well for me. The biggest difference is definitly the workload, especially since we're in person now and I don't
have that extra time in the mornings to get work done and instead use the time to commute or prepare to commute. So far I'm still managing though. </p>
</div>

<div align = "center">
<p> Even though I've never missed an assignment yet I still sometimes feel overwhelmed when I see how many things are on my plate. I've learned to 
sit back, relax, take a deep breath and realize that I've done this all before and that I'll get it all done by the due dates if I just follow my plan.
Speaking of which, possibly the biggest difference between highschool and college that I've noticed is the nature of work and assignments. Instead of 
just one presentation due in a few days or an essay due in a few weeks there are several simultaneous longer term projects. Take my current semester
for example: I'm working on one semester long code project, one about four weeks long code project and another four weeks long project for a technical
writing course. This is of course on top of the other assignments and things that are regularly due each week or every few weeks. Highschool class time
was often used for classwork and homework or things like essays were additional but minor compared to the amount of work done in class. In college, class
time is used for lecture time using slideshows and while there may be some class time given to work by far most work is expected to be done outside of class.
This took a little getting used to but overall it's been a good experience and I feel like I'm learning a lot of relevant skills that will help me get a job
one day.   </p>
</div>

<div align = "center">
<p> Something that has confused me is the request on some assignments, group and individual is the request to "take a risk and use new and different technologies". I
think this is an attempt to use the additional languages some students know from experiences outside of the program and get us to try new things. This fails
for several reasons. The first reason is that different students have different levels of knowledge from outside the program, some don't know any languages
from outside the program at all. In group projects this is a bottleneck, as you may want to try something you know from outside the program but unless 
everyone else in the group knows it too, the project will be a struggle and it's best instead to with what every one knows, the things covered in the program.
The second reason such an approach fails is simple risk/reward. A student could use the tools covered in the course to complete an assignment in two weeks
with relative ease and get full marks, or they could take a risk on a new technology and potentially encounter serious problems and struggle and end up losing
marks for no real gain. Simply put if there is lots of risk and no reward most students won't risk their grades for vanity, which is really the only thing
they would gain from using a new technology since they wouldn't gain enough confidence or experience with the tool(if they succeed in completing the assignment)
to put it on their resume and it's very unlikely the technology will be used later in the course.   </p>
</div>

<div align = "center">
<p> What I would propose instead is a pathway on assignments.
Give students the option to complete the assignment with technology A, covered in class or technology B, scouted out by professors and known to work for the 
assignment and has appropriate help and getting started resources already presented to help those wanting to explore. It's also possible to give those choosing
technology B extra time because some of this time would be spent learning the technology instead of performing tasks. I think this would be a much better solution
as drastically reduces the risk for the student since the assignment is known to have been completed before with the tool and it also helps the professor since
they know the student is using a reputable tool that the professor can boot on their system and since they have previous examples they will have a better idea
of how to mark it. However, I will admit that I am a part of the first ever intake for my program so this might not be possible at the moment, but I did want to make my case
for why I don't think telling students to take massive risks with their grades and offering no incentive is an idea that will not live up to expectations.
Outside of a few small nit picks here and there my college experience has been very positive, I've recommended the program to a prospective student who
asked me for advice and I feel that my program has prepared me well for my upcoming co-op work term.   </p>
